Git related:

Ran into several issues pushing the committed changes on the main R-file to the repository. These ranged from the remote being ahead of main to
"several simultaneous pushes to the repository" blocking any pushes that I would attempt, to the most common error: 
>>> C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main
To https://github.com/benjcarlton/RDD
 ! [rejected]        HEAD -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/benjcarlton/RDD'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details..

General issues related to me being a Github novice:
setting up the inital connection between the remote and main branch took an embarrassingly long time to get established, leaving gaps in version updates
Not wanting to have a documented list of my errors, I waiting to start uploading code until I had a good amount of it working

R-related:
Version of R that I initially used was not compatible with the version of the libraries that I was using, leading to delays in initial file uploads
Figuring out how things tied together in some of the functions took longer than expected
Getting a widely-used package to make tables took up the bulk of the learning, and is still not perfected

Lessons learned:
take the time to ensure that everything is set up before starting project work
find, collect, and save code for commonly used tables, functions, and graphs
double check everything, sleep on it and double check it all again
