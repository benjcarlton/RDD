Git related:
Ran into several issues pushing the committed changes on the main R-file to the repository. These ranged from the remote being ahead of main to
"several simultaneous pushes to the repository" blocking any pushes that I would attempt.

General issues related to me being a Github novice:
setting up the inital connection between the remote and main branch took an embarrassingly long time to get established, leaving gaps in version updates
Not wanting to have a documented list of my errors, I waiting to start uploading code until I had a good amount of it working

R-related:
Version of R that I initially used was not compatible with the version of the libraries that I was using, leading to delays in initial file uploads
Figuring out how things tied together in some of the functions took longer than expected
Getting a widely-used package to make tables took up the bulk of the learning, and is still not perfected

Lessons learned:
take the time to ensure that everything is set up before starting project work
find, collect, and save code for commonly used tables, functions, and graphs
double check everything, sleep on it and double check it all again
