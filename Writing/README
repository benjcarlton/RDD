Attempt at recreating some of the figures from Hansen's research, and answers some questions related to causal inference that are 
explored within the paper. 

Authour is new to R so forgive the repeat use of code and strange method of version control and file management (working with problems 
as I find ways to address them through trial and error. Hope someone finds something here useful.

Cheers!
